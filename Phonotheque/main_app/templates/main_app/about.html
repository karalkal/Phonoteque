            <h2 class="tm-text-primary mb-3 text-center h3--about">Introduction</h2>
            <p class="col-12 p--about--text">
                Phonotheque is a basic student project created using the Python-based framework Django. <br>
                It is intended to combine social media, online forum, data scraping and storage features. All these
                are implemented at a very rudimentary level and Phonotheque should not be seen as anything but an
                experiment.<br>
                At the same time, the potential for expanding it by adding new services and components, improving
                its design, security and functionalities is virtually unlimited. <br>
                In brief: After successful registration and logging in, the users are given the opportunity to
                extend their profile by entering additional data. <br>
                They can then add their favourite albums to the database. To achieve this the website attempts to
                fetch information from Wikipedia. If successful the album
                data will be stored in the DB and will be linked to the relevant user (many-to-many relationship
                using intermediary model).<br>
                Artists' names (one-to-many relationship) will also be retrieved and stored. <br>
                Logged in users will be able to view the profiles of other users, their shared albums and, if they
                wish, add someone else's shared album to their own favourites. <br>
                They can also post comments related to any album from the DB (one-to-many relationship). <br>
                Inappropriate content can be disabled or deleted by the admins, who also have privileges to disable
                or delete profiles, either by accessing the admin panel or via the website's own GUI. The superusers
                will have full privileges to manipulate the DB.</p>

        <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-4 col-sm-12">
            <p class="col-12 p--about--text">
                Phonotheque uses the default Django User Model. There are different schools of thought
                on what is the best way to customize the user model (creating a custom User model via
                AbstractBaseUser if the intention is to change the authentication procedure or via AbstractUser if
                additional info about the user needs to be collected/stored being popular choices).<br>
                I decided instead to stick to the other recommended strategy of extending the default Django User
                model with a One-to-One relationship to a Profile model as I am perfectly happy with the Django User
                defaults - everything works out of the box, is compatible with all third party modules while at the
                same time the Profile model provides extendability and flexibility.</p>
            <h4 class="tm-text-primary text-left h4--about">Registration</h4>
            <p class="col-12 p--about--text">
                When an anonymous user wishes to create an account they are presented with the UserRegistrationForm.
                This form takes care of the front end formatting and apart from the default Django validation
                performs validation of the first name and second name entries – both should be with a length of
                between 2 and 35 characters and must be satisfying the condition <code>VALID_NAME_REGEX = r"^([
                    \u00c0-\u01ffa-zA-Z'\-])+$" </code>which is a complicated way to say that our user can have a name
                like <strong>Jérémie O'Conor-IVANOVäüïöëÿâçéèêîïôčšžñáéíóúü</strong>but cannot be named R2D2,
                number1, st*r or f### #ff. <br>
                Once an user is created with the Django-default fields, a corresponding entry will be created in the
                <strong>Profile</strong>table as well (with null values for photo_URL, date_of_birth, gender,
                description) by just linking (via the Primary key) the newly created user to their profile. <br>
                In other words, since in our Profile model we have the corresponding user as a primary key:<br>
                <code>
                        class Profile(models.Model):<br>
                        &nbsp user = models.OneToOneField<br>
                        (settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL,<br>
                        &nbsp on_delete=models.CASCADE,<br>
                        &nbsp primary_key=True)
                    </code><br>
                in <code>register_user_create_profile</code>view we just create a profile with relevant pk: <br>
                <code>new_profile = Profile.objects.create(user=new_user) </code><br>
            </p>
            <h4 class="tm-text-primary text-left h4--about">View other users' profiles</h4>
            <p class="col-12 p--about--text">
                Logged in users can view profiles of other registered user. It is debatable whether this
                functionality is better suited for accounts app or the main app, but I concluded this was the more
                appropriate place for it. The relevant DetailView is named ProfileDetailView and by using
                <code>LoginRequiredMixin</code>we make sure only logged-in users can view the profile info of
                others. By overriding <code>def get_context_data(self, **kwargs)</code>method data for the
                searched_user is added to the context variable and can then be passed to the relevant template. The
                logged-in user's profile will be listed first in turquoise background, so that it could be
                distinguishable from the rest.)
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-4 col-sm-12">
            <h4 class="tm-text-primary text-left h4--about">Profile Editing</h4>
            <p class="col-12 p--about--text">
                The profile is editable (names and email can be changed, username cannot) and additional data
                can be added if the user wishes to do so – gender (selecting from pre-defined options), description,
                date of birth (must be in range between today and 1920) and photo (the development version was based
                on uploading actual image files but deploying it with media files seemed a bit too much hassle, e.g.
                submitting credit card details for verification, therefore the live version expects an URL for a
                profile photo instead).<br>
                Essentially, at this point the newly created user can actually create a meaningful profile as upto
                this point their profile data contains nothing (apart from reference to the relevant user
                entry).<br>
                The profile editing functionality is accessible from the <strong>Profiles</strong>link in the main
                menu. Clicking it redirects to a gallery-style list of all non-staff users. The logged-in
                user's profile will be displayed first, with turquoise background and with 'view', 'edit' and
                'delete' buttons.<br>
                The edit_user_and_profile (name could have been more appropriate, I guess…) presents the user with
                one visible form to fill which actually consists of 2 model forms - <code>user_form =
                    UserEditForm </code>and <code>profile_form = ProfileEditForm</code>. By using the
                <code>@login_required</code>
                decorator the view makes sure only the logged-in user can access this page. At the same time the
                verification <code>if user_instance != request.user and not request.user.is_staff:</code>ensures
                anyone who is not the logged-in user or isn't member of staff cannot access the page even if they
                try to manipulate the url - they will be redirected to the profiles-list page and a message "Yo! Are
                you trying to edit someone else's profile? Tut-tut..." will be displayed. <br>
                If the validation is passed successfully , the verified data is being saved in the relevant columns
                in the <strong>User</strong>and <strong>Profile</strong>tables. <br>
                The user is then redirected to their own profile details page where they can view the
                updated data; a confirmation message is being displayed too.<br>
                Staff users can edit regular users' profiles and have an additional button appearing above the
                currently viewed user's data - if the users is <code>if request.user.is_staff:</code>they can
                switch between DE-activating or RE-activating the relevant profile with <code>
                    user_to_edit.is_active = not user_to_edit.is_active </code>(This functionality is implemented in a
                dedicated <code>deactivate_or_reactivate_user</code>view). Deactivated users will no longer be able
                to Sign In to the system and their profiles will be visible to staff (displayed with reddish
                background) but will remain invisible to regular users.<br>

        <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-4 col-sm-12">

            <h4 class="tm-text-primary text-left h4--about">Profile Deletion</h4>
            <p class="col-12 p--about--text">
                Profile deletion functionality is being accessed in pretty much the same way (via
                <strong>Profiles</strong>link). Logged-in user's own profile (first in list and with turquoise
                background) has a <strong>Delete</strong>button displayed. If they click it they will view their
                profile data and be asked if they wanted to proceed with the deletion.<br>
                Staff users with the appropriate permissions have the ability to not only edit but also delete
                regular users' profiles. (A two-category separation of duties applies also to staff permissions
                to edit or edit AND delete comments - see the Admin section below.)<br>
                Again, if an unauthorised user attempts to delete another user's profile by messing up with the url,
                they will be prevented from doing so and will get a message "Ooopsy! User {instance.username} won't
                be happy if you delete their account. Luckily you can't do it.)"<br>
                If authorised the user will see the <code>UserAndProfileDeleteForm</code>ModelForm which will
                display relevant data about the profile (username and date joined amongst others) and ask if the
                user is sure they wish to proceed with the deletion.<br>
            </p>
            <h4 class="tm-text-primary text-left h4--about">Logging In</h4>
            <p class="col-12 p--about--text">
                Logging in functionality relies on the default Django CBV LoginView. By overwriting its <code>def
                    __init__(self, *args, **kwargs)</code>method we ensure that the login form is displayed with the
                required styling – this approach seems more straightforward than creating a custom
                AuthenticationForm. The success URL is the logged in user’s dashboard (will be explained later).<br>
                Once logged in the Register button in the main manu will be replaced with a Profile button where
                users will be able to edit their profiles.

            <h4 class="tm-text-primary text-left h4--about">Logging Out</h4>
            <p class="col-12 p--about--text">
                Logging out also relies on the default LogoutView. Once logged out, the user will be redirected to
                the index page by using <code>next_page = 'index_page'</code>while overriding its <code>def
                    dispatch(self, request, *args, **kwargs) </code>method will add appropriate messages (“You have
                successfully logged out from your account.” and “You can either close this tab or Sign In again”) to
                be displayed as well

                styling by overwriting its <code>def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs)</code>method.

        <h2 class="tm-text-primary mb-3 text-center h3--about">Main App</h2>
        <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-4 col-sm-12">
            <p class="col-12 p--about--text">
                The main app allows users to share their favourite albums as well as to discuss albums already
                shared on the platform with other users. Obviously, an album is a very specific object (not only in
                the programming sense of the word) – it is not comparable to sharing someone’s personal experiences
                or ideas on a blog site or even listing items for sale on an online shop. A music album is an unique
                item – it has properties which remain constant for everyone, anywhere and anytime -
                its cover image, date of issue or musicians involved won't change. We need to somehow ensure our
                website can <strong>identify the correct object</strong>>and make it available for sharing, liking
                or whatever else is required. <br>
                Therefore, for this scenario to be meaningful it is essential to gather our data from a reliable
                source and luckily Wikipedia (God bless everyone involved in the project!) provide great API
                which interacts perfectly with Django/Python.<br>
                Basically, the general idea is to retrieve album data (I won’t call our basic searches ‘web
                scraping’ but to some degree this is what we are doing here.) from Wikipedia’s API which has been
                imported in the project (alongside some other modules which seem to have mutual dependencies). <br>
                Once obtained, the album data is being displayed and if the user wishes they can add it to
                their personal <strong>Collection </strong>albums (see ERD for clarification). <br>
                By doing this they also create a
                record for the Album in the DB as well as for the Artist but only if these are not already present
                there. <br>
                Then can then view their favourite albums in their personal dashboard and for each album they
                can view additional info like comments from users and which other users, if any, have
                liked this album (displayed in chronological order). <br>As a side note, I would say this
                particular part of the application provides significant
                potential and incentive to continue working on it as there is a wide range of possibilities to
                add new features – for example IM system, tagging system, automatic recommendations based on custom
                criteria, recommendations from other users, creation of interest groups, ‘friendship’ FB-style…</p>
            <h4 class="tm-text-primary text-left h4--about">Home Page/Index</h4>
            <p class="col-12 p--about--text">
                The index page is accessible for both anonymous and logged-in users. The difference is that the
                former will see a short message explaining the raison d'etre of this web page. Logged-in users
                presumably will not need this.<br>
                The index page functionality is based on Django’s default ListView. It implements pagination and the
                template will display a gallery-style list of all albums shared on the platform (ordered
                chronologically, newest first) as well as the number of users who have liked each of them.</p>
            <h4 class="tm-text-primary text-left h4--about">Album Details</h4>
            <p class="col-12 p--about--text">
                <code>AlbumDetailView(views.DetailView)</code>is also visible to anonymous and logged-in users.
                Anonymous users can view the stored album information and click a link to the full Wikipedia article
                (opens in new tab). However, logged-in users will be able to:
            </p>
            <ul class="p--about--text" style="list-style-type: square;">
                <li>delete the album from their collection if it is present there</li>

                <li>view comments posted by users</li>
                <li>post a comment</li>
                <li>see which users have liked the same album</li>
                <li>access the profile pages of these users by being redirected to the relevant URL</li>

            <p class="col-12 p--about--text">
                To achieve all that the view performs a series of queries which are then added to the context (with
                <code>get_context_data(self, **kwargs)</code>) alongside the Comment form and sent to the template.
                The template then has access to variables like <code>others_who_liked_it</code>,
                <code>album_to_unlike_pk</code>,
                <code>liked_by_current_user</code>.

                The artist name will be clickable in the album details template and will redirect to another

                index one but with albums related to the selected artist only. This is being achieved by overriding

                    </code>
                Since the Album table only stores artist_id as foreign key we need to get the name of the artist and
                add it to the context.

            <h4 class="tm-text-primary text-left h4--about">Comments </h4>
            <p class="col-12 p--about--text">
                The <code>class CommentCreateView</code>inherits from <code>views.CreateView</code>and
                <code>PermissionRequiredMixin</code>,
                i.e. only logged-in users will be able to view comments and post new ones. If an user crates a new
                comment via its related <code>ModelForm</code>it will be saved in the DB by creating record
                of its text content as well as the user and album id’s it is related to via its FK.<br>
                <code>
                        def form_valid(self, form):
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;comment = form.save(commit=False)
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;comment.user = self.request.user
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;comment.album = Album.objects.get(wiki_id=self.kwargs['album_wiki_id'])
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;return super().form_valid(form)
                    </code>
                The view will then redirect again to the same album info page where the user’s newly published
                comment will be visible at the top as comments are displayed by their creation time, most recent
                first.

            <h4 class="tm-text-primary text-left h4--about">Dashboard</h4>
            <p class="col-12 p--about--text">
                Logged-in users have access to their personalized dashboard. Actually this is the page they are
                being redirected to as soon as they are logged in. <br>It lists, again gallery-style and with
                pagination (4 items on a page) their favourite albums while the two forms below initiate the
                Wikipedia search - these are actually are the bottom of the main logic of the webpage – titled
                ‘Search for an album by artist and title…’ (uses forms.Form) and ‘... or paste album's Wikipedia
                link below’.<br>
                They both redirect to the relevant URLs and, subsequently, to either
                <code>find_album_by_title_and_artist(request)</code>or <code>
                    find_album_by_url(request)</code><br>
                Again, this section of the website could be extended by adding all sorts of functionalities -
                any sort of data a proper music lover might get from or about like-minded people could be displayed
                there.
            </p>

            <h4 class="tm-text-primary text-left h4--about">Retrieving the data from Wikipedia</h4>
            <p class="col-12 p--about--text">
                Each of these views calls a separate function which does the Wikipedia search for us.<br>
                1) <code>def get_wiki_info_by_album_name(search_term)</code>will initially retrieve a
                <strong>wikipedia.page
                    object</strong>from the top result from Wikipeadia’s API with the search_term argument (please
                note: the search term provided by <code>find_album_by_title_and_artist(request)</code>will
                initially be only the <strong>album name only</strong>, if unsuccessful it will search with artist
                name added too.)<br>If the string 'album' is not present in the summary of the Wikipedia article
                returned to us it will retrieve the first 8 results, will look for the string ‘album’ in these as
                well and if again it finds nothing will return None, None (for album and artist) to
                the view, the dashboard page will reload with an appropriate message. If successful though it will
                send the wikipadia.page object to a function called assign_values(page_object).<br>
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-4 col-sm-12">
            <p class="col-12 p--about--text">
                2) <code>def get_wiki_info_from_url(album_url)</code>works in a similar and maybe not the optimal
                manner - there might be a more intelligent method to get wikipedia info from a wikipedia link rather
                than obtain a string from the link itself and then use it to search the website. It will strip
                everything from the link provided apart from the actual article name
                (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ride_the_Lightning becomes just Ride_the_Lightning), will replace
                most of the undesired escaped characters (Ride_the_Lightning becomes Ride the Lightning) and will
                invoke the same <code>assign_values(page_object) </code>function with the wikipadia.page object if
                found, if not it will return None, None (for album and artist) to the view.<br>
                The <code>assign_values(page_object)</code>function will create a dictionary with all album data
                contained in the page_object, removing everything contained in round brackets from article names
                (Animals (Pink Floyd album) becomes just Animals), including an album cover URL.<br>
                The artist name will be retrieved from a particular section in the Wikipedia’s article html – each
                Wikipedia album page has a side section titled something like ‘Studio album by Massive Attack’. By
                searching the raw html with if <code>'album&#60;/a&#62;&#32;by'</code>in raw_html and with some
                slicing, splitting, cutting and torturing we can hopefully get the artist name and return it to the
                relevant function alongside the album data.<br>
                Then the above-mentioned functions will return themselves the wiki_info, artist to the corresponding
                views. </p>

            <h4 class="tm-text-primary text-left h4--about">Saving the data from Wikipedia</h4>
            <p class="col-12 p--about--text">
                As mentioned before the data from Wikipedia will be returned to either
                <code>find_album_by_title_and_artist(request) view</code>or <code>find_album_by_url(request)
                    view</code>. The first one basically prepares the search term based on the user input and invokes
                the above-mentioned function with <code>album_wiki_info, artist_name =
                    get_wiki_info_by_album_name(search_term)</code>.<br>
                If None is returned the view will redirect back to dashboard with the message We couldn't find an
                album called {album_name} by {searched_artist}.<br>
                If successful it will send the data to the template called <code>album_found.html</code>and,
                crucially, will <strong>‘attach’ the retrieved data to the session</strong>- <code>request.session['data']
                    = artist_name, album_wiki_info</code>so that it could be used/saved later if the user confirms in
                <code>album_found.html</code>that they wish to save this album.
                The <code>find_album_by_url(request)</code>view works in a very similar way.<br>
                If the user confirms the displayed album is indeed what they were looking for, they will be
                redirected to save_artist_album_data(request). Then we follow the following consequence of steps to
                save the data:<br>
                1) Unpack the additional data we stored in the session with artist_name, album_wiki_info =
                request.session['data']<br>
                2) Check if artist already in DB, if not create record (we will need that later if we have need to
                save the album in our DB).<br>
                3) We try to get the album with this wiki_id from DB.<br>
                4) If it is there (no exception is raised) we check if this album is already in users collection and
                if yes redirect to dashboard again with the message The Album {album.title} by {album.artist} is
                already in your favourites'.<br>
                5) If getting the album from the DB fails with ObjectDoesNotExist exception we will create a new
                Album object adding the artist_object as FK too.<br>
                6) Once we make sure artist name is stored in DB we get it in case we need it as a FK.<br>
                7) Then we can it to the users own collection with Collection.objects.create(user=user, album=album)
                and display message 'The album {album.title} by {album.artist} has been saved in your
                favourites'<br>

                The permissions system of Phonotheque is based on 3 staff groups with different level of

                view privileges. <br>
                A group of lower level moderators can de-activate comments and users (if for example an
                inappropriate content has been detected) and another group will be able to delete these comments and

                In other words users will be able to view
